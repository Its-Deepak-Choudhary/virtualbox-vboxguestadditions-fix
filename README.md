To address the "VBoxGuestAdditions During certificate downloading: Unknown reason" error in VirtualBox when trying to start or run a virtual machine, here's a solution using terminal commands. I'll explain the solution in both English and Hinglish, along with an example.

### Solution in English:

This issue can occur due to the `kvm` (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module interfering with VirtualBox's guest additions. You can fix this by unloading the `kvm` and `kvm_intel` kernel modules.

Follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal.**

2. **Switch to root user (administrator privileges):**

   ```bash
   sudo su
   ```

   When you run this, it will ask for your password. Enter your password.

3. **Check if the `kvm` modules are loaded:**

   ```bash
   lsmod | grep kvm
   ```

   This command will show if `kvm_intel` and `kvm` modules are currently loaded. If the output shows something like this:

   ```bash
   kvm_intel             487424  0
   kvm                  1425408  1 kvm_intel
   irqbypass              12288  1 kvm
   ```

   It means that the `kvm` modules are active.

4. **Unload the `kvm_intel` module:**

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel
   ```

5. **Unload the `kvm` module:**

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe -r kvm
   ```

6. **Try running your VirtualBox VM again.** This should fix the error related to "VBoxGuestAdditions During certificate downloading."

#### Example:

Let's say your username is `Demo`. You would do the following:

```bash
sudo su
[sudo] password for Demo: ********
root@DA:/home/hero# lsmod | grep kvm
kvm_intel             487424  0
kvm                  1425408  1 kvm_intel
irqbypass              12288  1 kvm
root@DA:/home/hero# sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel
root@DA:/home/hero# sudo modprobe -r kvm
```

Now, after unloading the modules, try to run your VirtualBox VM again. It should work fine.
