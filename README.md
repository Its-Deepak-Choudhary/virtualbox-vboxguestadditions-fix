# Fix for "VBoxGuestAdditions During Certificate Downloading" Error in VirtualBox

                                            ![ðŸ‘‰](https://github.com/Its-Deepak-Choudhary/virtualbox-vboxguestadditions-fix/blob/master/Error.png)

If you're facing the **"VBoxGuestAdditions During certificate downloading: Unknown reason"** error while using VirtualBox, this guide provides a quick and easy fix. The issue is usually caused by **kvm (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)** modules conflicting with VirtualBox.

## Solution Overview

The solution involves unloading the **kvm_intel** and **kvm** kernel modules, which are often loaded by default on your system. This conflict can cause errors in VirtualBox, but with just a few simple commands, we can resolve it!

## Steps to Fix the Error

### 1. Open Your Terminal

Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open the terminal.

### 2. Switch to the Root User (Administrator Privileges)

Run the following command:

```bash
sudo su
```

You'll be prompted for your password. Enter your password to gain root access.

### 3. Check if kvm Modules are Loaded

Use this command to see if the kvm modules are currently active:

```bash
lsmod | grep kvm
```

If you see something like this:

```bash
kvm_intel             487424  0
kvm                  1425408  1 kvm_intel
irqbypass              12288  1 kvm
```

It means that the **kvm** modules are loaded.

### 4. Unload kvm Modules

Now, unload the modules using the following commands:

```bash
sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel
sudo modprobe -r kvm
```

### 5. Start Your VirtualBox VM

Finally, try running your VirtualBox VM again. The error should be fixed!

## Example Walkthrough

Let's say your username is **Demo**. The process would look like this:

```bash
$ sudo su
[sudo] password for Demo: ********
root@DA:/home/demo# lsmod | grep kvm
kvm_intel             487424  0
kvm                  1425408  1 kvm_intel
irqbypass              12288  1 kvm
root@DA:/home/demo# sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel
root@DA:/home/demo# sudo modprobe -r kvm
```

After unloading the kvm modules, try starting your VirtualBox VM again, and the error should no longer occur.

## Additional Notes

* **Reloading kvm Modules:**
  If you need to reload the kvm modules in the future (e.g., for running KVM-based VMs), you can do so with the following commands:

  ```bash
  sudo modprobe kvm_intel
  sudo modprobe kvm
  ```

* **Updating VirtualBox and Guest Additions:**
  If the problem persists, make sure you're using the latest versions of both VirtualBox and the VirtualBox Guest Additions.

---

## Quick Summary

* Open a terminal and switch to root user (`sudo su`).
* Check if **kvm_intel** and **kvm** modules are loaded (`lsmod | grep kvm`).
* Unload them with `sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel` and `sudo modprobe -r kvm`.
* Run your VirtualBox VM again. The error should be fixed!
